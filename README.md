Octane Remix
----------------------

A high-energy, customizable racing game.

"Octane Remix takes racing to a new level with environmental hazards and obstacles to an extreme on tracks that defy reality. The hazard customization elements and combinations, referred to as Remixes, creates an experience where you can feel competition from yourself in timed solo runs, local Player vs. Player, and with other players externally competing for the best score."

"The game pushes your ability to learn and adapt your driving to real life environmental hazards escalating all the way up to conditions you wouldnâ€™t dream of driving in or around; such as irregular gravity, laser beams, and full track loops to name a few. There would also a single player grand prix style campaign to play through races against AI with increasing difficulty."

Created by students at Campus Gotland, Uppsala University originially for the Gotland Game Conference 2020.
